<h2>web이란 무엇인가?
</h2>
<p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website" target = "_blank" title = "html">Website</a> is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment or social networking. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page. As of December 2022, the top 5 most visited websites are Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
